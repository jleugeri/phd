# Ancillary code for plots within my thesis

In this repository, I collected ancillary code used to generate the figures shown in the body of my dissertation. I publish these scripts here as-is for reasons of transparency and as a reference for those who are interested in reproducing or modifying them.

> :warning: Some of these code-snippets are still to be documented. If there are questions that require clarification, please open a [new issue](issues/new)!
